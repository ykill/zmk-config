To revive a classic board, Nice!Nano V2.0 is paired with a shield containing two SN74AHC595 shift registers to handle 79 of the keys. Two GPIO keys handle the remaining Power and Caps Lock. An encoder with switch is provided. This is for Apple 658-4081 ALPS switch variant ONLY. SMK switch variants have a different footprint so this PCB is incompatible.
