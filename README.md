To revive a classic board, Nice!Nano V1.0 is paired with a daughterboard containing two SN74AHC595 shift registers. This provides 16 columns and 6 rows to accomodate 81 keyswitches of the A9M0330 or 658-4081, and leave room for encoders and LEDs on the N!N GPIO. A complete replacement PCB with socketed Nice!Nano is planned.
